# Privacy Policy – Sudoku Expert

This Privacy Policy describes how **Sudoku Expert** (“the app”) handles information.

### Summary

* The app works **offline** and does **not collect or share personal information**.
* Your data (preferences) (if any) are stored **locally on your device**.
* The app shows **no ads** and uses **no analytics or tracking SDKs**.

### Data Collection and Sharing

We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data to our servers. The app does not have a user account system and does not require you to provide personal information.

### On-device Data

The app may store **app preferences/settings** locally on your device (for example: selected generator type, last-used ranges, formatting options, or UI preferences) so the app can remember your choices.

Generated values are produced on-device. The app does not automatically upload or sync generated content.

##### Backups

Depending on your Android settings, app data may be included in your device backups (e.g., Google backup). We do not receive access to your backups.

### Permissions

The app is designed to work without special permissions. If a feature allows you to **share or export** generated results, it uses Android’s system sharing / file picker features and performs exports only when you explicitly choose to do so.

### Third-party Services

The app itself does not integrate third-party tracking.

Google Play may provide aggregated crash and performance information to developers (Android vitals) to help improve stability.

### Children’s Privacy

The app is not designed to collect personal information from anyone, including children.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time by posting the new version on this page. The “Effective date” below shows when it was last updated.

### Contact

If you have questions about this policy contact us.


**Effective date**: 2026-01-07
