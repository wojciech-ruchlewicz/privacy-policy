# Privacy Policy – Barcode Generator

This Privacy Policy describes how **Barcode Generator** (“the app”) handles information.

### Summary

* The app works **offline** and does **not collect or transmit personal data to the developer’s servers**.
* Codes and labels you create are stored **locally on your device**.
* The app shows **no ads** and uses **no analytics or tracking SDKs**.
* If you choose to **share/export** a generated code image, the content you entered (e.g., a phone number embedded in a QR code) may be shared with the app you select.

### Data Collection and Sharing

We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data to our servers. The app does not have a user account system.

The app can generate codes that may contain user-provided information (for example, a QR code encoding a phone number). If you use Android’s **Share** or **Save/Export** functions, the generated image/file (and its encoded content) may be transferred to the app or service you choose (for example, a messaging app, email client, cloud drive, etc.). This happens **only when you explicitly initiate it**.

### On-device Data

The app stores the barcodes/QR codes you create (and optional labels/notes) **on your device** so you can view and manage them later.

##### Backups

Depending on your Android settings, app data may be included in your device backups (e.g., Google backup). We do not receive access to your backups.

### Permissions

##### Camera

* The camera is used only to scan barcodes/QR codes.

##### Storage / Files (legacy and current versions)

* Some older versions of the app may allow saving exported barcode images to device storage (including removable storage / “SD card”, depending on the device and Android version).
* Newer versions may use Android’s system file picker / sharing features to save or share files without requesting broad storage access.
* The app does not read your personal files, and any export is performed only when you explicitly choose to save or share an image/file.

### Third-party Services

The app itself does not integrate third-party tracking.

Google Play may provide aggregated crash and performance information to developers (Android vitals) to help improve stability.

### Children’s Privacy

The app is not designed to collect personal information from anyone, including children.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time by posting the new version on this page. The “Effective date” below shows when it was last updated.
